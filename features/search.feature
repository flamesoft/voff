Feature: Maps pins
    So that I can see where nearby dogsitters are located
    I would like to be able to see the pins on a map

Background:
  Given that following dog sitters exist in the system
  |name             |address1             |zip    |city         |latitude  |longitude |
  |Jenny            |Storgatan 1          |11444  |Stockholm    |59.3358043|18.0779299|
  |Yan              |Ostindiefararen 29   |41765  |Gothenburg   |57.6992599|11.9078464|
  |Calle            |kampementsgatan 14   |11538  |Stockholm    |59.3461377|18.1010713|
  |Daniel           |Vasagatan 36         |41124  |Gothenburg   |57.6987945|11.967052 |

Scenario: User sees searched place on the page
    Given I am on the "home page"
    And I fill in "location" with "Stockholm"
    And I fill in "Date" with "2016-06-03"
    And I click on the "Search" button
    Then I should see "Stockholm 2016-06-03"

 @javascript
 Scenario: Map center and search results
    Given I am on the "home page"
    And I fill in "location" with "Örebro"
    And I fill in "Date" with "2016-06-30"
    And I click on the "Search" button
    #Then I should see a map centered at latitude "59.2781424" and longitude "15.1324149"
    And I should see a pin on the map
#    And I should see "Anna"
